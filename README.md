# saliency localizer

saliency localizer lets you:

* train a network to localize bees' tags.
* load weights of a trained network and use it to detect bee's tags. The weights
  are in a [sperated git repostory](https://github.com/nebw/saliency-localizer-models).

See the IPython Notebooks on how to use it or get in touch with
[ben](https://github.com/nebw).
